In your experiments.js,

- Write some code that declares two variables, character and timesToRepeact.
- Using a loop, repeat that character that many times and then console.log it.
- Example, if I had character = 'f' and timesToRepeat = 5, it'd console.log `'fffff'`.

Try a few different combinations to make sure you got it right e.g. 'a' and 10, 'c' and 100, '🐶' and 3.
