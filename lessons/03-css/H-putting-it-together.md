So far I've shown you a lot of various techniques but we haven't really put it together yet. So let's do that now, let's put together a new paper front page.

Here's the design:

![The News Times design](/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/images/the_news_times.png)

Here are the product requirements:

- Implement however you see fit. There are many right ways to do this.
- The nav links at the tops are indeed links. It should underline whenever a user hovers on it.
- You can put any image there but I used `http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/dog25.jpg`
- I'll give you the HTML (since in this section we're just worried about CSS.) [Grab the HTML here][html] (you'll have to right-click and click "View Source"). You don't necessarily have to modify the HTML but you can if you want to.

[See my version of the CSS here][my-version] once you've tried yourself. It's okay to struggle. This is putting a lot of hard stuff together. Give it a shot before looking at how I did it. A learning is doing while you struggle.
