One of the most common ones is we want to change an element when someone hovers their mouse over it. Like this box:</p>\n<p>The CSS we used for this is this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-html\">&lt;style&gt;\n  .hover-example {\n    width: 100px;\n    height: 100px;\n    background-color: limegreen;\n    color: white;\n  }\n  .hover-example:hover {\n    background-color: crimson;\n    width: 150px;\n    height: 150px;\n  }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;hover-example&quot;&gt;Hover your mouse over me&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>:hover</code> part selects that element <strong>only when that condition is true</strong>. There are are many <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/\">CSS pseudo classes</a> like being able to only select the first element of something like this:</p>\n<p>The CSS for this is:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-html\">&lt;style&gt;\n  .first-child-example {\n    color: crimson;\n  }\n  .first-child-example:first-child {\n    color: limegreen;\n  }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li class=&quot;first-child-example&quot;&gt;First&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li class=&quot;first-child-example&quot;&gt;Second&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li class=&quot;first-child-example&quot;&gt;Third&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This only selects the element if it is the <em>first element</em> inside of a tag. Otherwise it won&#39;t select it. There are numerous other CSS classes; check out the CSS-Tricks article if you want learn more.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pseudoelements\">Pseudoelements</h2>\n<p>We&#39;re not going to dwell too much on pseudoelements as they are a bit of an advance concept. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/pseudo-selectors/b/after-and-before/\">Read here</a> for a more in-depth dive on it. But let&#39;s have a quick example.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-html\">&lt;div class=&quot;chapter&quot;&gt;This is a chapter of my book.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;chapter&quot;&gt;This is a second chapter of my book.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n  .chapter {\n    margin: 0;\n  }\n  .chapter::after {\n    content: &quot;❦&quot;;\n    font-size: 50px;\n    text-align: center;\n    display: block;\n  }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Do you remember at the end of a chapter of some books, they have a little embellishment to let you know you&#39;ve finished a chapter? That&#39;s called an end mark. Many use one called a fleuron and that&#39;s what the ❦ character is. Let&#39;s say we wanted to write CSS to automatically insert that character after every chapter class in our book</p>\n<p>(By the way you can totally use CSS for print layouts like books and newspapers.)</p>\n<p>Every element has a <code>::before</code> and an <code>::after</code>. You can use these <em>pseudoelements</em> to insert things there like we did with the fleuron.</p>\n<p>Again, not the most common thing to do, just wanted you to be aware of it. You will in old code and documentation see <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> but these are old and now are <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> so that pseudoclasses (like <code>:hover</code>) and pseudoelements (like <code>::after</code>) can be disambiguated by syntax.</p>\n","slug":"pseudoclasses-and-pseudoelements","title":"Pseudoclasses and Pseudoelements","section":"CSS","icon":"palette","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/03-css/C-pseudoclasses-and-pseudoelements.md","nextSlug":"/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/css/layout-css","prevSlug":"/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/css/selectors-and-the-cascade"}},"__N_SSG":true}
