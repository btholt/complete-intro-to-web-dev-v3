{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"description":"Brian teaches what tags are, the foundation unit of HTML."},"html":"<p>We&#39;re going to start building our very first website. At first, our website is going to be pretty ugly, but it&#39;s still going to be functional! We&#39;re going to be using the language HTML, or hypertext markup language. This isn&#39;t a programming language since it doesn&#39;t actually <em>do</em> anything. It&#39;s like how English isn&#39;t a programming language either: you can&#39;t &quot;run&quot; English. Same idea with HTML: you can&#39;t &quot;run&quot; HTML. HTML is simply the language and pictures on the page. It&#39;s the static (which is another word for unchanging) content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tags\">Tags</h2>\n<p>HTML&#39;s base building block is the <strong>tag</strong>. A tag is a building block. It describes what&#39;s inside it. Every tag has an opening and a closing tag (some tags open and close at the same point.) I think the easiest way to learn it is just to show a bunch of examples.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-html\">&lt;h1&gt;This is the title to my document&lt;/h1&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> surrounding the text &quot;This is the title to my document&quot;. This is how HTML operates. You can have an opening tag which has information or more tags inside of it. In this case we have an <code>h1</code> tag which is a heading tag: it&#39;s used for the biggest title on the page, typically a title. If you rendered that using the browser, it looks like:</p>\n<h1>This is the title to my document</h1>\n\n<p>It&#39;s bigger and bolder because that&#39;s what browsers do with h1s, it makes them look important on the page. However it does more than that too. Browsers aren&#39;t the only thing reading websites. Blind and people who can&#39;t see well will use screen readers to read web pages out loud to them; it uses things like headers to understand what information is important to read to the users. It&#39;s also how Google and Bing will understand the important details of your website. In other words, it&#39;s important which type of tag you use. More than just the visual aesthetic is using those tags.</p>\n<p>A tag, whether it&#39;s opening or closing, is surrounded by angle brackets, <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. Closing tags always have a slash, <code>/</code>, after the opening angle bracket, so it looks like <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>. There are things called &quot;self-closing tags&quot; or &quot;void tags&quot; that open and close themselves. These will look like this: <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> (I&#39;ll explain in a sec what inputs are.) That slash at the end means it is self-closing. To make it more confusing, that last slash is optional, so <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> (with no closing tag ever) is valid too since input tags are always self-closing.</p>\n<p>Tags are also opened and closed in a specific order too. The most recently opened tag must be the next closed tag. For example, if I have an h1 instead of a div, the h1 must be closed first.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-html\">&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Hi&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above is correct.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-display-html\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">h1</span>&gt;</span>\n    Hi\n  <span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">div</span>&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;/<span class=\"hljs-name\">h1</span>&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above is incorrect. I can&#39;t close the div <em>before</em> I close the h1 since the h1 was the last one I opened.</p>\n","slug":"tags","title":"Tags","section":"HTML","icon":"code","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/02-html/A-tags.md","nextSlug":"/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/html/types-of-tags","prevSlug":"/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/welcome-to-the-class/what-are-you-going-to-learn"}},"__N_SSG":true}
