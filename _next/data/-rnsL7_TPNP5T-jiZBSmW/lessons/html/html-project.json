{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"title":"HTML Project","description":""},"html":"<p>Here is your first HTML project!</p>\n<p>We&#39;re making your personal blog. Feel free to use the project we started in the last lesson. Here are your requirements</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your blog has two pages: index.html and about.html</li>\n<li>Your index.html needs a title and a quick intro.</li>\n<li>Your index also needs a link to about.html.</li>\n<li>You blog must have five posts on it (you can just keep it all on the same page).</li>\n<li>Each post needs:<ul>\n<li>A title</li>\n<li>An author</li>\n<li>The date it was posted (feel free to make up times)</li>\n<li>The text of the blog post. Bonus points if there are multiple paragraphs. Feel free to use <a href=\"https://loremipsum.io\">Lorem Ipsum</a> if you want placeholder text.</li>\n<li>Bonus points for images.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Your about.html needs<ul>\n<li>The name of your blog</li>\n<li>A few paragraphs about you</li>\n<li>A list of your recent jobs/schools/accomplishments</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Quick note on how to do an image: put the image in the same directory as the index.html and about.html and then put <code>&lt;img src=&quot;the-name-of-the-file.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a text description of what the image is for sight-impaired folks&quot; /&gt;</code> to render the image.</p>\n<p>This will mostly be black and white and that&#39;s okay. You can come back and restyle this later with CSS.</p>\n<p>Here is my example: <a href=\"https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/project-files/blog/index.html\">Brian&#39;s Blog</a> (you&#39;ll have to right click and say &quot;View Source&quot;)</p>\n","slug":"html-project","title":"HTML Project","section":"HTML","icon":"code","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/02-html/F-html-project.md","nextSlug":"/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/css/rules","prevSlug":"/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/html/head-and-meta-tags"}},"__N_SSG":true}
