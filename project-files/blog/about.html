      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Brian Holt. I am a resident of Seattle, Washington and live
        here with my wife, son, and dog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I work at Stripe as a product manager of developer tools.
        Before I worked at Microsoft, LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit, and other
        smaller companies. I am currently working my masters of business
        administration degree at Seattle Univeristy.
      </p>
      <p>Here are some interesting accomplishments about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I once won a gaming tournament when I was six. We played Sonic &
          Knuckles.
        </li>
        <li>
          I ate burritos with the band Sugarcult. I don't even like Sugarcult.
          The burritos are the highlight of this story.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am one of the very few people to never graduate college nor ever
          take the standardized test GMAT and yet still be accepted into a
          master's program.
